Traffic control is a challenging problem in many cities. This is due to the large number of vehicles and the high dynamics of the traffic system. Poor traffic systems are the big reason for accidents, time losses. In this method of approach, it will reduce the waiting time of the vehicles at traffic signals. The hardware design has been developed using Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL) programming.
